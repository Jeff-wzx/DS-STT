# DS-STT
A Driving-Style-Aware Spatial-Temporal Transformer for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction. This repository provides the implementation of DS-STT, which integrates spatial-temporal encoding and driving-style modeling to achieve accurate and interpretable trajectory prediction on real-world autonomous driving datasets.
