# DS-STT
This repository contains the official implementation of DS-STT, a driving-style-aware spatial-temporal transformer designed for vehicle trajectory prediction. The model integrates spatial-temporal encoding with explicit driving-style modeling to achieve accurate and interpretable prediction performance on real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
